# Release History

## Version 0.2

Not released yet

### Features

* New ContextualOptimizer: C-CMA-ES (based on CMA-ES)

### Breaking Changes

* C++: BehaviorSearch, Optimizer, and Environment have an additional
  parameter 'config' in their 'init' function. The YAML-based configuration
  string will be given. Each implementation of this function must be able to
  cope with an empty config string. In this case all parameters will be
  set to their default values.
* C++: The controller will run 'reset' of the environment once directly after
  'init' before the first episode is executed.

### Documentation

* Documented `context_features` of CREPSOptimizer

## Version 0.0.1

2017/05/19

First public release.

### Breaking Changes

In comparison to the old behavior learning framework used by the DFKI RIC and
the University of Bremen, we changed the following details:

* Python interface: changed signature int `Environment.get_feedback(np.ndarray)`
  to `np.ndarray Environment.get_feedback()`
* Python interface: `ContextualEnvironment` is now a subclass of `Environment`
* Python interface: renamed `Environment.get_maximal_feedback` to
  `Environment.get_maximum_feedback`
* Python and C++ interface: `Behavior` constructor does not take any arguments,
  instead the function `Behavior.init(int, int)` has been introduced to
  determine the number of inputs and outputs and initialize the behavior
* Python interface: Optimizer and ContextualOptimizer are independent
* Python interface: BehaviorSearch and ContextualBehaviorSearch are independent
